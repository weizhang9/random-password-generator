## Random password generator

This is a random password generator that takes desired password length from command line and returns a random password of chosen length. Currently the generated password contains alphanumeric and special characters. Maybe it will allow user to choose what characters the password should contain in the future if I got time (or feel free to contribute and implement it, or even better make it a command line tool instead of running locally).

### How to use
- clone the repo
- run `cargo run src/main.rs`
- input your desired password length as instructed in your command line
- copy the generated password for your use
